This assignment demonstrates the implementation of two key navigation patterns in a mobile application interface. Firstly, a tab-based navigation system featuring SignIn, SignUp, and Calculator screens
allows users to switch between different functionalities seamlessly. Each tab is visually distinct, with customized active and inactive states to enhance usability.

Tab-Based Navigation System:

Tabs: Implemented tabs for SignIn, SignUp, and Calculator screens. Tabs are typically located at the bottom or top of the screen, allowing users to switch between different functionalities of the app.
Visual Distinction: Each tab is designed to be visually distinct. This differentiation helps users quickly identify which screen or functionality they are currently viewing or selecting.
Customized States: Tabs have customized appearance for both active and inactive states. An active tab is visually highlighted to indicate the current screen, while inactive tabs are styled differently to show they are not currently selected.

Navigation Drawer:

Hamburger Menu Icon: Included a hamburger menu icon (three horizontal lines) to indicate the presence of a navigation drawer. Tapping or swiping this icon initiates a slide-out animation.
Slide-Out Animation: When activated, the navigation drawer smoothly slides out from the side of the screen, revealing additional navigation options or menu items.
Menu Items: Designed menu items within the navigation drawer. These items are clickable and allow users to navigate to different sections or screens of the app, providing an alternative way to access app functionalities.
Custom Styling: The navigation drawer is customized with icons and styling to match the overall design aesthetic of the app. This customization enhances the visual appeal and usability of the drawer.
